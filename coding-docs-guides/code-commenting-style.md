**Telegraphic Technical Commentary Style**

A minimalist, robotic commenting approach that strips documentation to functional essentials while maintaining clarity.

**Key characteristics:**
- Telegraphic language - omit articles (a, an, the) where possible, replace with commas if needed
- Technical shorthand - abbreviated, functional notation
- Stream-of-consciousness flow - thoughts as they occur during coding, but at the block/method level, not low level unless it's complex.
- for simple code, comments should most likely be kept to a minimum and only at the block-level or higher.
- Robotic tone - matter-of-fact, mechanical delivery
- Selective pronoun use - occasional personal pronouns but sparingly
- No capitalisation - all lowercase
- Comma substitution - replace hyphens with commas
- Sharp, jutting syntax - fragmented sentences acceptable
- British English spelling - -ise not -ize, -our not -or

**Guidelines for creating comments:**
- Strip non-essential words ruthlessly
- Use commas instead of hyphens for separation
- Keep tone flat, robotic, functional
- Omit articles where sentence remains clear
- Use minimal punctuation
- Write as if documenting process in real-time
- Focus on what code does, not why it's brilliant
- Embrace fragmented, telegraphic structure
- Maintain eng spelling conventions

# ========================================
# DOCKER COMPOSE REMOTE - VM PRODUCTION DEPLOYMENT
# ========================================
# This compose file is designed for PRODUCTION use on Google Cloud VM.
# - Uses pre-built image from Docker Hub (no local build required)
# - Activates PROD profile (VM IP Stripe URLs, production webhook)
# - Fast deployment: pulls image instead of building from source
#
# Usage on VM: sudo docker-compose -f docker-compose.remote.yml up -d
#
# NOTE: Do NOT use for local testing with Stripe payments.
# For local testing, use docker-compose.yml with devprod profile instead.
#
# This demonstrates the CD pipeline output - pulling and running
# the production-ready image that was built and pushed by GitHub Actions.
# ========================================

# IMPORTANT: For payment testing, run Stripe CLI in a separate terminal:
#   stripe listen --forward-to localhost:8080/api/payments/webhook
# Stripe CLI requires host machine authentication and cannot run inside containers.
# See docs-guides/payment-feat-introduction.md for full setup instructions.

services:
  # MySQL Database Service
  # FLYWAY INTEGRATION: Schema is now managed by Flyway (not manual SQL scripts)
  # - On first run (empty volume): MySQL creates empty 'webapp' database
  # - Spring Boot starts → Flyway runs migrations V1→V2→V3 → creates all tables
  # - On restarts (existing volume): Flyway checks flyway_schema_history, skips already-applied migrations
  # - Volume reuse is safe: Flyway won't re-run V1/V2/V3 if history table shows they're applied
